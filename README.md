# Football Director Simulator
## fd-sim
A small Football Manager simulator focussed only on the role of The **Football Director**.

Scout players, buy/sell and make your procedurally generated team great.

I started working on this game ages ago, I tried many times to rewrite it in different programming languages (previous attempts are all among my repos), and now decided to go with [golang](https://go.dev) and [fyne](https://fyne.io).

## DevLog
I am doing a devlog on my mastodon profile, in this chain of toots.

Also I keep updating some videos on youtube on this playlist once I believe something looks interesting to showcase.
